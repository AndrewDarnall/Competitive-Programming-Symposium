# Leetcode, a Software Engineer's old friend

Growing up when there used to be ***a day in the life*** videos of *Software Engineers* from **FAANG** companies, I was inspired by the technical prowess of some
especially their deep knowledge of *competitive programming* and **algorithmic style interviews**, not so much because I wanted to work for a big tech comapny and be
at the front of technological innvoation (before the C-suite started reaping engineers left and right), but because I always wanted to master **algorithmic thinking**
and **solving riddles**

This repo is in *no way* professional but since I'm not paying for the **leetcode cloud** to store my solutions, this will act as a ***cloud storage*** of my
take on the solutions of said problems since I now *only* do them for fun, since they soon will be (thankfully) replaced with more **effective** interviews that
can **truly** assess the technical capacity of aspiring **Software Engineers**

This is repo will get ***random*** updates since I am re-writing all my solutions in Python and solving problems as they come

> feel free to open an issue to diss my solutions and claim YOUR technical superiority!
